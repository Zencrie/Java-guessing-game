 * Assignment 3: Guessing Game GuessingGame Class
 * Completed January 6th, 2021
 * Elyssa Grant
 * Description: A class to hold the number to be guessed and most of the code to play the guessing game. 
 * 
 * Variables: bytGuess.................Holds the guess the user inputted to be checked against the correct number
 *            bytRandomNum.............Holds the randomly generated number the users are trying to guess
 *            bytScoreHolder...........Temporarily holds the score of the player so it can be added to 
 *            players..................An ArrayList that holds all the instances of the user's first names, last names and current scores
 *            finalWinner..............A variable of type Player that takes in the information of the user with the highest score at the end
 *            strYesNo.................Holds the response of the user to various questions that can be answered by yes or no
 *            strTempFName.............Temporarily holds the user's first name so it can be put into the ArrayList
 *            strTempLName.............Temporarily holds the user's last name so it can be put into the ArrayList
 *            Winners..................An ArrayList that holds the first names of all the users who guessed the number correctly this round
 *            strKeepPlaying...........Holds whether or not the user would like to play another round of the guessing game
 *            booRunner................Holds a true or false statement to keep several loops running until the user does what they are supposed to
 *            k........................Holds the counter for a for loop
 *            element..................Temporarily holds the data of another variable to run a for each loop
